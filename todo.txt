# PyFGH

To Do:

FGH code (Completed 26 June, needed: Possible further testing of MCSCF, visualization of wavefunctions)
FGH for quantizing a proton: defined box, autobox, cutoff tests,gridpoint density tests, CUDA
FGH for normal mode analysis and vibrational polarizabilities: all pyscf
IRSEC module: for gaussian logs and pyscf

**FGH for vibronic: will require extensive work
